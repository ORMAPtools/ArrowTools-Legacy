Download and install the [ORMAParrowTools.esriaddin](https://github.com/ORMAPtools/ArrowTools-Legcay/raw/master/ORMAParrowTools.esriAddIn) file. Select a feature template in the Create Features window, then select an arrow tool. Right clicking anywhere on the map will bring up a context menu which has a selection for the help file. There you will find everything that the tool does.
